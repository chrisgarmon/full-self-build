# Project Overview
- Name: Regenerate AI
- Stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Firebase Functions, Notion, Infisical, Vector DB (Qdrant/Pinecone/pgvector)
- Goals: clean, testable code; minimal secrets exposure; stable APIs

# Style & Conventions
- Language: TypeScript, strict mode on
- Patterns: functional-first; DI for external services; small, pure functions
- Tests: write tests first when feasible; include edge cases; keep examples minimal but runnable
- Errors: Never swallow; return typed `Result` or throw with clear messages

# Commit & PR
- Use conventional commits; small, focused PRs; include a quick "why" in PR body

# LLM Behavior
- Prefer minimal, working diffs
- If task is ambiguous, propose 2â€“3 succinct approaches, then implement the chosen one
- Always include a short rationale in code comments for non-obvious decisions
